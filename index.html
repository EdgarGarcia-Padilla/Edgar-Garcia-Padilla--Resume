         Hello! My name is Edgar Garcia-Padilla and I am 19 years old. I was born in Pomona but mostly grew up in Ontario, California. I grew up learning how to play soccer which is a sport that I am very passionate about. Soccer is everything to me and means a lot. Soccer taught me a lot of lessons and has made me a better man today. Without soccer I wouldn't be in the position I am today. Soccer is a stress reliever for me. I am a 1st year Pre-Business major in the University of California, Riverside. I graduated with a 3.7 GPA average from Colony High School. I was part of the AVID program, a program that helps 1st generation students in their familes apply to college. I was on the varsity soccer team for 2 years, which helped in working together as a team in order to achieve a goal; a skill needed for future jobs. I did volunteer work at a kids center in the Citrine Hills Apartment Complex. I helped organize activites, helped with homework, and helped keep the center clean. I learned a lot from this experience, especially dealing with younger kids. I became more patient and more understanding and kept calmness which is a very good skill to have.  <br><br>

          I used to work at GCS which is a catering business based in San Fernando, California. I helped organize the catering sets in which we would travel to areas in LA. I set up tables, the fruit stands, deserts, and the chaisr. I helped with preparing and cutting any fruits and vegetables. My occupation was being an assistant cook. I would help the main cook with anything he needed. I currently work at Galaxy Hamburgers which is a fast food place with a variety of foods such as burritos, burgers, salads, mexican food, greek food, sandwhiches, and a varitey of breakfast options. I am working cashier in which I take orders and give people their food. I clean tables, make shakes or fraps, fill up the dressings, and prep anything that is needed to be done. I work great with a team and is very good at communicating with others. I am always available in helping others with any issue that occurs. I am a very responsible person who likes doing everything the best way I can in order to impress anyone higher up than me. I can be seen as a good example for others with my work ethic and all these skills I have mentioned. This can influence other people in my eventual profession to do the same.
          I am a very reliable person. I have great availability and always shows up to work promptly with an eagerness to do everything in my control the best way possible. I am very attentive to small details as I think they matter in getting the results you want. I am very calm and understanding; it is important to have those skills in order not to make any decisions emotionally.
